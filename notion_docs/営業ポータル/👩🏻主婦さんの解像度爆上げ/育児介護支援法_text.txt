Outline of the Act on Childcare Leave, Caregiver Leave, and Other Measures for the 
Welfare of Workers Caring for Children or Other Family Members 

＜育児・介護休業法の概要（英語）  平成 31 年 3 月作成＞ 

For a safe and sustainable society, the issues of having to choose between work and marriage / childbirth / 
childcare, or work and caregiving, and establishing work-life balance need to be resolved. Based on this idea, 
the Act  on  Childcare  Leave,  Caregiver  Leave,  and  Other  Measures  for  the  Welfare  of  Workers  Caring  for 
Children or Other Family Members promotes support for workers to accommodate both home and work needs, 
when their time is constrained due to private situations like childcare and caring for family members.

Childcare leave <Article 5 to 9-2> 

Definition 

In principle, leave that a worker takes to take care of a child who is less than one year of age 
*  “Child”  means  a  child  (including  an  adopted  child)  who  is legally  in a  parent-child  relationship  with  the 
worker, as well as a child under a pilot adoptive period ahead of adoption, and a child with foster parent(s).   

Target 

• Workers (excluding temporary daily workers) 
• Limited-term contracted workers need to fulfill the following requirements when applying for the leave. 

(1)  The worker has been employed at the current workplace for a year or more. 
(2)  It is not established that the work contract ends and does not get updated by the time the child reaches 
18 months of age (24 months if the childcare period ends when the child reaches 24 months of age).   

<Workers in a labor-management agreement who are excluded from the eligibility> 

(1) The worker has been employed at the current workplace for less than a year. (2) The work relationship ends within 
a year from the date of application (six months, if the childcare leave ends when the child reaches 18 months or 24 
months of age) .(3) The worker works for two scheduled working days or less a week. 

Period 

•  In principle, until the child reaches one year of age (14 months in certain cases, 18 months for reasons 
such as admission to a nursery school has not been available, and 24 months if the child still cannot be 
admitted to a nursery school). 

•  If the father and mother both take childcare leave, the leave shall be one year until the child reaches 14 

months of age (Father and Mother Child Care Leave Plus).   

Frequency 

•  In principle, one leave per child (childcare leave for the period before the child reaches 18 months or 24 

months of age is obtainable separately). 

•  If a worker who has not taken prenatal leave within eight weeks after the child’s date of birth or estimated 
date of birth (whichever happened later) takes the first childcare leave, the worker can take leave again 
without any special circumstances 

Procedures  The worker shall apply for the leave to the employer in writing, at least one month before the planned starting 
date of the leave (two weeks before, if the childcare leave is taken before the child reaches 18 months or 24 
months of age). 
* For unexpected circumstances such as the child was delivered before the planned date of birth, the worker can advance 
the leave’s starting date once. By applying for the leave  at least one month before the ending date of the leave (two 
weeks before, if the child leave is taken before the child reaches 18 months or 24 months of age), a deferred start of the 
leave will be possible irrespective of circumstances until the child reaches one year of age (or 18/24 months).

Measures to be established by employers <Article 21, 24, 26> 

Measures for 
Workers who take 
care of a child 
below primary 
school age or a 
family member 
requiring care 

<Childcare>

to  make  efforts 

to  establish 
measures needed for workers taking care of a 
child  below  primary  school  age,  such  as 
implementing a childcare leave system, system 
to  limit  work  in  excess  of  scheduled  working 
hours, and introducing flex hours 

•  Obligation  to  make  efforts  to  establish  a 
childcare leave system for workers taking care 
of a child below primary school age, such as a 
childcare leave system for partners   

<Nursing care for family members>

to  make  efforts 

to  establish 
measures  needed  for  workers  taking  care  of

to  accommodate  the  period  and  frequencies 
required for the care leave   

Measures about job 
assignment 

When the work location is changed, employers must consider the circumstances of the worker for 
whom the relocation will make it difficult to take care of their child or family members requiring care 
while maintaining his / her job.

/ nursing care 
availabilities 

•  Employers must make efforts to document the following in employment rules and share them with 

workers 
(1)   Compensation and other terms during childcare or caregiver leave 
(2)   Salary, job assignment and other work conditions after the childcare or caregiver leave 
(3)  Work restarting date and other terms if the childcare leave period ended because the child 

no longer needed care or the caregiver period ended because the worker no longer needed 
to take care of the said family member 

(4)   Social insurance payment terms during caregiver leave 

•  Employers must make efforts to notify the worker individually of systems they can use, when they 
come to know that the worker or his / her partner is pregnant or gave birth, or is engaged in nursing 
care for family members.
