For a s afe and sustainable society , the issue s of having to choose between work and marriage / childbirth / 
childcare, or work and caregiving, and establish ing work -life balance  need to be resolved . Based on this idea, 
the A ct on Childcare Leave, Caregiver  Leave, and Other Measures for the Welfare of Workers Caring for 
Children or Other Family Members  promotes support for workers to accommodate both home and work needs, 
when their time is constrained due to private situations like childcare and caring for f amily members.

(1) The worker has been employed at the current workplace for a year or more .
