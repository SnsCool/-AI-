  "transcript": "The club isn't the best place to find a lover so the bar is where I go\nMe and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow\nCome over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I'll give it a chance\nNow take my hand, stop, put that man on the jukebox and then we start to dance\nAnd now I'm singing like\nGirl, you know I want your love\nYour love was handmade for somebody like me\nCome on now, follow my lead\nI may be crazy, don't mind me\nSay, boy, let's not talk too much\nGrab on my waist and put that body on me\nCome on now, follow my lead\nCome on now, follow my lead\nI'm in love with the shape of you\nWe push and pull like a magnet do\nAlthough my heart is falling too\nI'm in love with your body\nLast night you were in my room\nAnd now my bedsheets smell like you\nEvery day discovering something brand new\nI'm in love with your body\nOh I, oh I, oh I, oh I\nI'm in love with your body\nOh I, oh I, oh I, oh I\nI'm in love with your body\nOh I, oh I, oh I, oh I\nI'm in love with your body\nEvery day discovering something brand new\nI'm in love with the shape of you\nOne week in and we let the story begin\nWe're going out on our first date\nYou and me are thrifty so go all you can eat\nFill up your bag and I fill up a plate\nWe talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour\nAnd how your family's doing okay\nLeaving, getting a taxi, kissing in the backseat\nTell the driver make the radio play\nAnd now I'm singing like\nGirl, you know I want your love\nYour love was handmade for somebody like me\nCome on now, follow my lead\nI may be crazy, don't mind me\nSay, boy, let's not talk too much\nGrab on my waist and put that body on me\nCome on now, follow my lead\nCome on now, follow my lead\nI'm in love with the shape of you\nWe push and pull like a magnet do\nAlthough my heart is falling too\nI'm in love with your body\nLast night you were in my room\nAnd now my bedsheets smell like you\nEvery day discovering something brand new\nI'm in love with your body\nOh I, oh I, oh I, oh I\nI'm in love with your body\nOh I, oh I, oh I, oh I\nI'm in love with your body\nOh I, oh I, oh I, oh I\nI'm in love with your body\nEvery day discovering something brand new\nI'm in love with the shape of you\nCome on, be my baby, come on\nCome on, be my baby, come on\nCome on, be my baby, come on\nCome on, be my baby, come on\nCome on, be my baby, come on\nCome on, be my baby, come on\nCome on, be my baby, come on\nCome on, be my baby, come on\nI'm in love with the shape of you\nWe push and

I'm talking loud, not saying much. I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet. You shoot me down, but I get up. I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose. Fire away, fire away. Ricochet, you take your aim. Fire away, fire away. You shoot me down, but I won't fall. I am titanium. You shoot me down, but I won't fall. I am titanium. Come on, down, but it's you who have further to fall. I'm ghost town, haunted love. Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones. I'm talking loud, not saying much. I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose. Fire away, fire away. Ricochet, you take your aim. Fire away, fire away. You shoot me down, but I won't fall. I am titanium. You shoot me down, but I won't fall. I am titanium. I am titanium. I am titanium. Stone hard, machine gun, firing at the ones who run. Stone hard, 'cause bulletproof glass. You shoot me down, but I won't fall. I am titanium. You shoot me down, but I won't fall. I am titanium. You shoot me down, but I won't fall. I am titanium. You shoot me down, but I won't fall. I am titanium. I am titanium. I am titanium. I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. Scared to rock the boat and make a mess. So I sat quietly, agreed politely. I guess that I forgot I had a choice. I let you push me past the breaking point. I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything. You held me down, but I got up. Already brushing off the dust. You hear my voice, you hear that sound. Like thunder gonna shake the ground. You held me down, but I got up. Get ready 'cause I've had enough. I see it all, I see it now. I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter. Dancing through the fire, 'cause I am a champion. And you're gonna hear me roar. Louder, louder than a lion, 'cause I am a champion. And you're gonna hear me roar. Now I'm floating like a butterfly. Singing like a bee, I earned my stripes. I went from zero to my own hero. You held me down, but I got up. Already brushing off the dust. You hear my voice, you hear that sound. Like thunder gonna shake the ground. You held me down, but I got up. Get ready 'cause I've had enough. I see it all, I see it now. I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter. Dancing through the fire, 'cause I am a champion. And you're gonna hear me roar. Louder, louder than a lion, 'cause I am a champion. And you're gonna hear me roar. I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter. Dancing through the fire, 'cause I am a champion. And you're gonna hear me roar. Louder, louder than a lion, 'cause I am a champion. And you're gonna hear me roar. You were the shadow to my light. Did you feel us? Another start, you fade away. Afraid our aim is out of sight. Wanna see us alive. Where are you now? Where are you now? Where are you now? Was it all in my fantasy? Where are you now? Were you only imaginary? Where are you now? I'm fading, I'm fading. I'm fading. Where are you now? Another dream. The monster's running wild inside me. I'm faded. I'm faded. So lost, I'm faded. I'm faded. So lost, I'm faded. These shallow waters never met what I needed. I'm letting go, a deeper dive. Eternal silence of the sea. I'm breathing alive. Where are you now? Where are you now? Under the brightness, the faded lights, you set my heart on fire. Where are you now? Where are you now?\n\n[Music]\nWhere are you now?\nI'm fading\nI'm fading\nWhere are you now?\nI'm fading\nI'm fading\nSo lost, I'm fading\nI'm fading\nSo lost, I'm fading\n\n[Music]\nWaiting for the time to pass you by\nHope the winds will change to change your mind\nI could give a thousand reasons why\nAnd I know you\nAnd you've got to\nMake it on your own but we don't have to go up, we can stay forever young\nLiving on my sofa, drinking rum and cola underneath the horizon sun\nI could give a thousand reasons why\nBut you're coming\nAnd you know that\nAll you have to do is say\nFor a minute, just take your time\nThe clock is ticking\nSo stay\nAll you have to do is say\nFor a second, your hands on mine\nThe clock is ticking\nSo stay\n[Music]\nAll you have to do is say\n[Music]\nAll you have to do is say\n[Music]\nWarning me what I already know\nI've never been the best at letting go\nI don't wanna spend the night alone\n'Cause I need you\nAnd I need to\nMake it on my own but I don't wanna go up, we can stay forever young\nLiving on my sofa, drinking rum and cola underneath the horizon sun\nI could give a million reasons why\nBut you're coming\nAnd you know that\nAll you have to do is say\nFor a minute, just take your time\nThe clock is ticking\nSo stay\nAll you have to do is say\nFor a second, your hands on mine\nThe clock is ticking\nSo stay\n[Music]\nAll you have to do is say\nAll you have to do is stay\nSo stay\nYeah\nAll you have to do is say\nFor a minute, just take your time\nThe clock is ticking\nSo stay\nAll you have to do is say\nFor a second, your hands on mine\nThe clock is ticking\nSo stay\nAll you have to do is say\n[Music]\nCall it love and devotion\nCall it a mom's adoration\nFoundation, a special bond of creation\nFor all the single moms out

mama, you never shed tear\n'Cause you have been setting things year after year\nAnd you give the youth love beyond compare\nYou find the school fee and the bus fare\nIn a wrong bar can't find him nowhere\nSteadily you work flow, every little you know\nSo you're not stop, not time, not time for your dear\nNow she got a six-year-old\nTrying to keep him warm\nTrying to keep out the cold\nWhen he looks in her eyes\nHe don't know he is safe when she says, \"Ooh love\nNo one's ever gonna hurt you love\nI'm gonna give you all of my love\nNobody matters like you\"\nStay up, stay up\nSo rockabye,
